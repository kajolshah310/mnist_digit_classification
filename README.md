# MNIST Digit Classification

## Description
This repository focuses on the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify the digits from 0 to 9.

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large number of grayscale images of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels. The task is to train a model that can learn from these images and predict the correct digit for new, unseen images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset. It contains a training set of 60,000 labeled examples and a test set of 10,000 labeled examples. The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels. Each pixel value represents the intensity of the corresponding pixel, ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

The MNIST dataset is often used as a starting point for learning and benchmarking machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of image classification.

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing, including resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
2. Implementation of deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM, for digit classification.
3. Model training and evaluation using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/mnist_digit_classification.git
```
2) Open the mnist_digit_classification.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the notebook, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of the digit classification model.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms or models, or explore additional techniques to improve the accuracy of the digit predictions.
